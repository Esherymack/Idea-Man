# Idea-Man
Generates ideas for fractals.

This bot is meant for use with Apophysis and Chaotica.

All variations that are not included with Apophysis 7x and/or Chaotica by default are able to be found in the [Aposhack Plugin Pack](https://www.deviantart.com/phoenixkeyblack/art/The-Aposhack-Plugin-Pack-98807426) or the [Essential Plugin Pack](https://www.deviantart.com/tatasz/art/Essential-Plugin-Pack-705591208) with the exception of Lazysensen, which can be found [here](https://bezo97.tk/plugins.html).

To launch: Put Discord bot token in a file called `token`. Launch as normal: `python ideaman.py`.

ToDo: Remove excess libraries that I probably added for no reason
